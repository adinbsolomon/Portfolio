### Developer Setup

Clone this repo, then `cd` into it and run `npm install`. You should be able to see your changes as you make them when you serve using `npm start` from the repo's directory.

### Adding your own content

The only sources of content are the Home and About pages, the projects on the project page, and the resume on the resume page.

To change the content on the Home and About pages, make changes directly to the Home and About components. You can add/modify/remove cards on the project page by editing `src/Assets/Data/projectList.js`: the `imgPath` field must be the filename of an image file in `src/Assets/Images/Projects`. To change the resume, you will need to change `src/Assets/Data/resume.pdf` (must be a PDF) and change the URL in `src/Components/Resume/ResumeRender.js`, the latter for which, in the interest of simplicity, I recommend a similar github raw path.

### Pushing to Github Pages

You can push your changes to github pages using `npm run deploy`.

Please follow the [instructions](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) on serving react apps with github pages!
